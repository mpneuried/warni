A helper to count alerts and send warnings or alerts not on every event.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/warni.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/warni/)

## Install

```
  npm install warni
```

## Initialize

```js
	var warnings = new Warni( { warn: 2, alert: 5, resend: 10 } );
	
	// listen to warnings
	warnings.on( "warning", function( data, count ){
		// generate your warning by sending it via Mail, Slack, HTTP or just log it to the console.
		console.warning( "WARNING! Got `" + count + "` issues of `" + data.title + "`\n" + data.details  )
	});
	
	// listen to alerts
	warnings.on( "alert", function( data, count ){
		// generate your warning by sending it via Mail, Slack, HTTP or just log it to the console.
		console.error( "ERROR! Got `" + count + "` issues of `" + data.title + "`\n" + data.details  )
	});
	
	// listen to the event until the ok was called.
	warnings.on( "ok", function( data, count ){
		// generate your warning by sending it via Mail, Slack, HTTP or just log it to the console.
		console.error( "OK! Back to normal operation after `" + count + "` issues of `" + data.title + "`\n" + data.details  )
	});
	
	// generate some issues
	for (idx = i = 0; i <= 110; idx = ++i) {
		warnings.issue( { title: "Huuuaaahhh üëª an Error ...", details: "Just Testing ;-) with index " + idx } )
	}
	// by the configuration above th following events will be fired at index:
	// - idx=2: a warning event 
	// - idx=5: the first alert
	// - idx=50: the second alert (a resend)
	// - idx=100: the third alert (a resend)
	
	
	// if everthing is operating normal you should call
	warnings.ok( { title: "OK üëçüèº", details: "Relax ... üçπ" } )
	
```

**Config-Options** 

- **warn** : *( `Number` optional: default = `2` )* Number of `.issue()` calls needed to send a warning event. A warning event will only fired once between an `ok()` and an `alert` event.
- **alert** : *( `Number` optional: default = `5` )* Alert of `.issue()` calls to send a alert event
- **alert** : *( `Number` optional: default = `10` )* Resend a new alert event after x alert events. So only do the next alert event after `alert` * `resend` calls of `.issue()`

## Methods

#### `.issue( [data] )`

Report a problem.

**Arguments** 

- **data** : *( `Any` optional )* Additional data to describe the issue within your event handlers

**Return**

*( Warni )*: The instance itself for chaining 


#### `.ok( [data] )`

Tell Warni everything is ok and reset the issue counter if needed.

**Arguments** 

- **data** : *( `Any` optional )* Additional data to describe the issue within your event handlers

**Return**

*( Warni )*: The instance itself for chaining 

## Events

#### `warning`

An early warning, that something is fishy ;-).
This is triggered once after `.issue()` iwas called `config.warn` times.

**Arguments** 

- **data** : *( `Any` )* The latest issue data you passed to `.issue(data)`
- **count** : *( `Number` )* The count of issues called until now.

#### `alert`

Generate an alert.
This is triggered if `.issue()` was called for `config.alert` or `config.alert * config.resend` times.

**Arguments** 

- **data** : *( `Any` )* The latest issue data you passed to `.issue(data)`
- **count** : *( `Number` )* The count of issues called until now.

#### `ok`

Reported issues is gone.
Triggered when `.ok(data)` was called after a `warning` event was triggered.

**Arguments** 

- **data** : *( `Any` )* The latest issue data you passed to `.issue(data)`
- **count** : *( `Number` )* The count of issues before the `.ok()` was called.

## Todos/Ideas

 * define a time in seconds until the next alert resend is allowed. With an increase of the time with every alert. 

## Testing

The tests are based on the [mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) framework with [should.js](https://shouldjs.github.io/) as assertaion lib.
To start the test just call

```
	npm test
```

or

```
	grunt test
```

If you want to be more precice use the mocha cli

```
	mocha -R nyan -t 1337 test/main.js
```

### Docker-Tests

If you want to test your module against multiple node versions you can use the docker tests.

**Preparation**

```sh
	# make sure you installed all dependencies
	npm install
	# build the files
	grunt build
```

**Run**

To run the tests through the defined versions run the following command:

```
	dockertests/run.sh
```
